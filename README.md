## Overview

This is a proof of concept that you can use NT_StartProcess (with powershell) to enable and disable a network adapter.

## Code Snippets

As with my previous example of tc3-ps-ping, we build the application with NT_Startprocess. This application does not require feedback so this greatly simplifies the task. To see how to return values from NT_Startprocess then check out [this](https://github.com/benhar-dev/tc3-ps-ping) repo for ideas.

Building the layers of this example, we start with the program we will execute. First, the code we will create in Powershell.

```powershell
Disable-NetAdapter -Name "X001" -Confirm:$false
```

```powershell
Enable-NetAdapter -Name "X001" -Confirm:$false
```

The above code will enable or disable X001 depending on which commands are used. For the examples below only the Disable will be used for simplicity.

To execute this on cmd you can use

```bash
powershell -c Disable-NetAdapter -Name "X001" -Confirm:$false;
```

We could now execute this directly using NT_StartProcess but this would causes the powershell window to pop-up which is not ideal.

In order to hid this we can use mshta to execute vbscript directly from the command line.

```
C:\Windows\System32\mshta vbscript:Execute(<<vb script goes here>>)
```

So combining the whole command together results in the following.

```bash
C:\Windows\System32\mshta vbscript:Execute("CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run ""powershell -c Disable-NetAdapter -Name """"X001"""" -Confirm:$false;"", 0: window.close")
```

The final step was to escape the $ using $$ in TwinCAT. From this point the command is compatible with NT_StartProcess.

```bash
Command : T_MAXSTRING := 'C:\Windows\System32\mshta vbscript:Execute("CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run ""powershell -c Disable-NetAdapter -Name """"X001"""" -Confirm:$$false;"", 0: window.close")';
```
